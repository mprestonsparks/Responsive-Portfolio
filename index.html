                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        I'm a 29-year old accountant from Nashville, TN transitioning into software development. I've worked across a wide range of industries, developing, implementing, and operating accounting systems for small to mid-sized companies. Unlike most developers, I'm familiar with the requirements of starting and running a business- dealing with customers, suppliers, government agencies and (occasionally conflicting) departmental needs.
                          <br><br>
                        This experience allows me to work directly with business owners, employees and other stakeholders to build solutions which are designed to meet their individual needs.
                          <br><br>
                        I'm a firm believer in being a life-long student and love to learn. Outside of software development and accounting, I enjoy studying a variety of topics, from psychology and philosophy to economics and religion.
                          <br><br>
                        I love to travel when the opportunity arises, enjoy anything outdoors, and would like to one day become a writer.
